  For getting a JAVA engineer job, 
I create this project to prove that I have ability to create 
a webapp by myself.


 This project is created with some technologies as follow.
1.Servlet  / JSP
2.MVC framework
3.JavaBean
4.Bootstrap framework
5.JDBC
6.jQuery / Ajax / Javascript

 Users can create their own account and sign in this webapp to write comment and edit comment.
